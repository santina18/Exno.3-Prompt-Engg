### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060225

### Aim: 
Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques

### Algorithm:  
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

### Prompts:
### 1. Straightforward Prompts:
These are simple, direct queries that help the chatbot handle common customer requests efficiently.

Scenario: A customer asks for product troubleshooting or order status.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query 1: "What do I do if my laptop isn’t turning on?"

Chatbot Response:

"First, make sure your laptop is plugged in and the power button is working. If it's still not turning on, try holding the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. Let me know if that works."

Customer Query 2: "Where is my order?"

Chatbot Response:

"Could you please provide your order number so I can check the status for you?"

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting:
This technique is helpful when the chatbot needs to present structured data or comparisons in an easy-to-read format, like troubleshooting steps, order status, or product comparisons.

Scenario: A customer asks about product features or compares multiple models.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query: "Can you show me a comparison of the two models?"

Chatbot Response:

"Sure, here's a table comparing the two models for you:"
| **Feature**      | **Model A**        | **Model B**        |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Screen Size**  | 15.6 inches        | 14 inches          |
| **Processor**    | Intel i7           | Intel i5           |
| **Battery Life** | 8 hours            | 6 hours            |
| **Weight**       | 2.5 kg             | 2.0 kg             |

Chatbot Response:

"Here's a table with steps to troubleshoot your issue:"
| **Step** | **Action**                                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Ensure the device is plugged in and the power button works. |
| 2        | Check for any visible damage to cables or power ports.     |
| 3        | Hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset the device.  |
| 4        | If the issue persists, contact customer support.           |

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting:
This technique involves using context from previous customer queries to ensure that the chatbot gives relevant and continuous support.

Scenario: The chatbot needs to maintain context across different queries or follow-up questions.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query 1: "I ordered a phone last week. When will it arrive?"

Chatbot Response: "Could you please provide your order number so I can check the status?"

Customer Query 2 (after the order number is provided): "What should I do if the phone has a defect?"

Chatbot Response: "Thank you for your order number. If your phone is defective, you can follow these steps for returns or repairs."

Customer Query 3 (follow-up after troubleshooting step): "It still doesn't work. What should I do next?"

Chatbot Response: "I see that the troubleshooting steps didn’t work. Let me escalate this issue to our support team for further assistance."
